#
# Program to work in conjunction with flag.cpp - provides inexact rounding.
#
# Carefull! This works  ONLY if all entries in the semidefinite program has integer
# values!!!! 
#  - This can be easily achieved by multiplying the objective function
#  - Also don't forget to multiply linear constraints if you use any
#  - If do not multiply the objective, you can provide a scale to this program to  make
#    the constants integers. No need to resolve the CSDP program. But linear constraints
#    are not scaled by this. Only the objective.
#
# This is a sage code for rounding CSDP programs
# It loads the solution, on every block X it computes decomposition
# that looks like X = A^T D A
# then it rounds A and D to Integers by multiplying by 1000000
# So all etries are integers scaled by 1000000^3
# If X is not a square block (slack variables and linear constraints - block
# with entries only on the diagonal), it is left as a row vector (1 x M) matrix.
#
# Moreover, the equations for flag algebras are actually inequalities.
# It makes no sense to round the 'slack variables' so the slack variables
# are all rounded to 0. Of course, the result are then inequalities and
# we just compute the minimum.
#
# Also, some SDP programs are way too big to fit in memory for rounding
# even on BIG machines.  A small workaround is that first, everything is
# rounded and then the rounding is tested and these can be separate  runs.
# Moreover, testing can be done by parts rather than all at once.
#
# Use Howto:
